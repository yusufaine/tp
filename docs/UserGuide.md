## Quick start

In this section, we will get you started on the things you need to do prior to using McKitchen -- namely, installing Java 11.

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your computer by clicking [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/version_manual.html).
    - If you do not have Java version `11` or later installed, refer to [this installation guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/overview-jdk-installation.html).

2. Download the latest `McKitchen.jar` from [our GitHub page](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your McKitchen.

4. To run the application:
   - Open the terminal in the _home folder_ (Step 3) and issue the following command: `java -jar McKitchen.jar`
   
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: :computer: **Alternatively**, you can allow the application Full Disk Access and be able to run the McKitchen by double-clicking on it by following [this post](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252709578).

</div>

The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

5. Type the command where prompted "Enter command here" and press Enter to execute it.
    * Example: typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window which would bring provide you with a link and direct you to the [Command Summary](#command-summary).

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

---

## Command Summary
### Understanding the command format
1. Almost all the details of the commands are needed to be given before the command can be executed properly.
    * **Optional** details of the command are enclosed in square brackets such as [optional details].
        + Example: `command <recipe name> or -x <recipe number from the list> [optional details]`
        + A clearer example of this can be seen in the [delete command](#delete-an-existing-recipe-delete), or [edit command](#edit-an-existing-recipe-edit).
      
2. What does it mean when the input command says "... separated by pipe"?
    * The pipe symbol is typically located above the "Enter" button on the keyboard and can be typed by using `Shift` + ``\ ``, resulting in `|`.
    * This means that the data you enter would be separated by the pipe symbol and would be as though you had entered them separately.
        + Example: `-t Western | Italian | Vegetarian` would be the same as `-t Western -t Italian -t Vegetarian`

## Features

In this section we would be going over what each feature does, how to go about doing so, and what it achieves. <br>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: :computer: **Quick note on [Save](#save-recipes) and [Load](#load-recipes)** these commands are done automatically, just like how Google documents automatically save your changes without you needing to explicitly run them. There are some advanced things that you can do with those features, and we recommend you to explore these features to find out more. <br><br>**Hint**: If your friends is using McKitchen, there's a way for you to share your recipe book with them.

</div>

### Add a new recipe: `add`
Add a recipe by specifying its name, ingredients, and steps to prepare the dish.<br>

Usage: `add -n <name of recipe> -d <completion time of recipe in minutes (max: 525600 mins)> -ss <serving size of recipe (max: 1000 servings)> -i <ingredients of recipes separated by pipe> -s <steps separated by pipe> [-t tags associated with recipe]`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: Ingredients, steps, and tags can be separated by pipe. <br>
:heavy_exclamation_mark: It is compulsory to specify the quantity of each ingredient that is to be added to the recipe. 
</div>


Example:
- Let's say you would like to add a new pasta recipe for "Aglio Olio" You'll need to specify:
    * the name: `-n Aglio Olio`,
    * the completion time in minutes: `-d 15`
    * the serving size: `-ss 1`
    * the ingredients: `-i spaghetti 56 grams | garlic 3 cloves | bacon 3 slices | olive oil 110 ml`
    * the cooking steps: `-s Cook the spaghetti until al dante | Saute the chopped garlic | Toss spaghetti in the sauce | taste and season with salt and black pepper`, and
    * **optionally**, the tags: `-t Western | Italian`

    <br>Putting them together, the command would look something like this:
  - `add -n Aglio Olio -d 15 -ss 1 -i spaghetti 56 grams | garlic 3 cloves | bacon 3 slices | olive oil 110 ml -s Cook the spaghetti until al dante | Saute the chopped garlic | Toss spaghetti in the sauce | taste and season with salt and black pepper` <br>
    (Note that this recipe already exists in the recipe book. If you want to test using this example, do a `delete Aglio Olio` first before continuing)

### Clear (delete all) existing recipes: `clear`
Removes all existing recipes in McKitchen. A confirmation prompt would show up before this operation is executed. <br>

Usage: `clear [-f]`

The program would then prompt you to confirm. Type in `yes` to clear and `no` to cancel the clear request.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:heavy_exclamation_mark: By specifying `-f`, you are letting McKitchen know that you are very sure about what you're doing and would proceed to removing all recipes without a confirmation prompt. 
</div>

Example:
- Let's say you would like to start from a clean slate and would like to populate McKitchen with your own recipes that you've created or sourced. Instead of deleting the default recipes one-by-one, you can do:
    1. `clear`
        - This would generate a clear request that requires a confirmation as seen in the screenshot below.

    ![Clear Confirmation](images/ClearConfirmation.png)

    2. `clear -f`
        - This would clear all entries **without** confirmation

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

️:heavy_exclamation_mark: :computer: McKitchen is only able to restore the default sample recipes by running `reset`. Currently, McKitchen isn't able to undo actions in the application so use this feature with caution!

### Delete an existing recipe: `delete`
Removes a stored recipe based on the number it is associated with in the `list` <br>
Usage: 
* `delete <recipe name>` <br> 
    or 
* `delete -x <recipe number from list>`

Example:
1. Tired of Aglio Olio? You can run the following command:
    - `delete Aglio Olio`
      - This would delete the recipe called "Aglio Olio".
2. What if you're too lazy to type the name and Aglio Olio is the **first** recipe in the list?
    - `delete -x 1`
      - This would delete the first entry in the list of recipes.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Deletion of recipes by its name are case-insensitive!**<br>
To make it a little more convenient for you, McKitchen is able to delete a recipe by its name by making it case-insensitive. This means that `delete aglio olio` works too!

</div>

### Edit an existing recipe: `edit`
Edits a recipe by specifying its name, ingredients, and steps to prepare the dish.<br>

> :information_source: **Only specify the parts of the recipe that you want to edit!** <br> 
> The only necessary information needed is the name, or number of the recipe that you would like to edit<br>

Usage: 
* `edit <name of recipe to be edited> [-n <new name of recipe> -d <new completion time of recipe (max: 525600 mins)> -ss <new serving size of recipe (max: 1000 servings)> -i <new ingredients of recipes separated by pipe> -s <new steps separated by pipe> -t <new tags associated with recipe>]` <br>
    or 
* `edit <-x recipe number to be edited> [-n <new name of recipe> -d <new completion time of recipe (max: 525600 mins)> -ss <new serving size of recipe (max: 1000 servings)> -i <new ingredients of recipes separated by pipe> -s <new steps separated by pipe> -t <new tags associated with recipe>]`

Example:
- Maybe Aglio Olio was missing some... spice? You can edit the existing Aglio Olio recipe by specifying:
    1. the new recipe name: `-n Spicy Aglio Olio`,
    2. the updated list of ingredients: `-i spaghetti 56 grams | garlic 3 cloves | bacon 3 slices | olive oil 110 ml | Chilli flakes 5 teaspoons`, and
    3. the updated cooking steps: `-s Cook the spaghetti until al dante | Saute the chopped garlic | Toss spaghetti in the sauce | taste and season with salt | black pepper and chilli flakes`
   
  Putting them together, you would get a command looking like this:
  - `edit Aglio Olio -n Spicy Aglio Olio -i spaghetti 56 grams | garlic 3 cloves | bacon 3 slices | olive oil 110 ml | Chilli flakes 5 teaspoons -s Cook the spaghetti until al dante | Saute the chopped garlic | Toss spaghetti in the sauce | taste and season with salt | black pepper and chilli flakes`

  <br>Alternatively you can specify the number in the list that is associated to Aglio Olio and run a command that looks like this
  - `edit -x 1 -n Spicy Aglio Olio [and other information that you would like to edit]`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: Notice how we did not specify the completion time (`-d`), serving size (`-ss`), and the tags (`-t`)? <br>This is because we want them to remain the same and as mentioned earlier, you will only need to specify the updated values.

### Find an existing recipe: `find`

* `find <keyword> [other keywords seperated by pipe]`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
️:heavy_exclamation_mark: At least one keyword must be provided in the user input.
</div>

Example: 
- Let's say that you would like to cook a Western cuisine and have spaghetti and garlic on hand. <br>
    The command that you would execute should look something like this:
    - `find western | spaghetti | garlic`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Keywords used for the find feature are case-insensitive!**<br>
Don't worry, McKitchen would still be able to find "Secret Family Sauce" even if you search for "secret family sauce" (or searching for the secret ingredient). :wink:

:information_source: **Order of the specified keyword does not matter!**<br>
McKitchen will still return the same result despite how you order the keywords!

## FAQ
**Q: If I am unsure of the exact amount of ingredients im adding into my recipe, can I save it first and come back to it later?** <br>
You cannot save the recipe with empty fields. Instead, you can add a dummy value into the field you are unsure of, then edit it after you are sure of the input values.

**Q: Is there a faster way to delete a recipe instead of copying the recipe name word for word?**<br>
The fastest way is to delete a recipe by its number in the list `delete -x <recipe number>`

**Q: How do I transfer my recipes to another computer?**<br>
Copy the recipebook.json file into your new computer.

**Q: What do I need to consider when _adding_ a new recipe?**<br>
You need to consider the:
1. Recipe name (`-n`),
2. Completion time (`-d`),
3. Serving Size (`-ss`),
4. Ingredients (`-i`),
5. Steps (`-s`), and
6. (Optional) Tags (`-t`)

**Q: If I deleted one of the provided (default) recipe by accident, can I retrieve it back?**<br>
You can use the reset command to retrieve the recipe. For newly added recipes, you will not be able to undo your deletion. 

**Q: If I typed in 'clear' or 'reset' in the command bar, will it take effect immediately?**<br>
It will not take effect immediately. A confirmation prompt will allow you to confirm your decision. Alternatively, you can specify the prefix -f to clear or reset without any confirmation prompt. 

**Q: With the find command, can I exclude recipes with ingredients that I don't have?**<br>
Unfortunately, our application only allows you to find recipes base on what you have.
