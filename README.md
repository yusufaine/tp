**McKitchen** (My-CLI-Kitchen) is a desktop application that can quickly store, edit, and search for recipes by running a single command, ideal for the fast typists, home cooks, and students who want a simple way to store or search for simple recipes to cook. The user interacts with it using a CLI-like interface, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
